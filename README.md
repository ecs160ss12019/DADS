# DADS - Missile Command

Team DADS (Davis Aerial Defense System) will create their own version of the classic game “Missile Command” which was originally released for the Atari 2600 in 1981. Our team consists of four members: 
* Jack Abukhovski, a fourth-year CS major. He enjoys playing Counter-Strike and soccer. 
* Shayan Mandegarian, a fourth-year CS major. He enjoys drinking boba and driving. 
* John Park, a fifth-year CS major. He enjoys summer school at Davis because the town is empty. 
* Jack Retterer, a fourth-year CSE major. He enjoys throwing rocks at the moon.

In the game, Hornets from Cal State Sacramento fly overhead to kill the cows of Davis. The brave CS Majors manning DADS shoot missiles from their decked out water tower to kill the Hornets before they can destroy the town. The Hornets shoot their stingers in a straight-line trajectory from above, and the DADS missiles also fire in a straight line and explode at the coordinates given. The point is to engulf the Hornets’ stinger in the radius of the explosion.

There are only six cows left, and if the Hornets successfully destroy all of them, then Davis is finished. If DADS successfully wards off a wave of Hornets without losing them all, they will 'find a way' to get six cows again before the next wave. 

With each wave there are more Hornets and their stingers travel with higher velocity, but there are also helpful powerups like ammo packs coming down occasionally too to help keep DADS in the fight. Destroy hornets and save as many cows as possible each round to rack up points and try to defend Davis as long as you can!
